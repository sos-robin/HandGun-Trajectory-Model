HandGun-Trajectory-Model
Description
The HandGun-Trajectory-Model simulates the trajectory of a bullet fired from a handgun considering the effects of gravity, air resistance, and wind. The simulation uses the Euler method for numerical integration to calculate the bullet's path.

Features
Simulates bullet trajectory using the Euler method
Considers air resistance and wind effects
Plots the trajectory of the bullet
Determines if the bullet hits a target at a specified distance

Requirements
Python 3.x
matplotlib library

Significance
The HandGun-Trajectory-Model is a valuable tool for understanding the dynamics of bullet flight under realistic conditions. By incorporating factors such as gravity, air resistance, and wind, this model provides a more accurate representation of bullet trajectories than simple parabolic equations
